Once the window is open, you can move it around and dock it wherever you like in the editor.<br>
#### <b>Generating a palette</b>
Change the colour harmony rule by selecting a new option from the dropdown.<br>
Editing the base colour will automatically generate a new palette based on the selected harmony rule.<br>
You can then edit the generated palette by clicking on the other colour fields.<br>
